        "The __init__ method is called when an instance of the class is created. It initializes the instance variables with the provided values. Self is a reference to the current instance of the class, and it allows you to access the instance variables and methods within the class. Name and value are parameters that are passed when creating an instance of the class, and they are used to set the instance variables self.name and self.value."
        self.name = name # This assigns the name parameter to the instance variable self.name
