COMMENT

# bash is for Command Line Interfaces, and CLI languages can be rather complex. bash itself is not as complex as others

echo "Hey man!" # Prints "Hey man!" echo is the keyword used for printing out data
a=1 # Variables should not have spaces when being defined
b="2"
echo "$a" # Prints the value of a
echo "$b" # Prints the value of b
echo a # Prints a (literally, not variable value)
echo "$a + $b" # This substitutes $a and $b, placeholders, with the actual variables 
echo a and b returned $((a + b)) # Math operation using variables; $ indicates the value of the variables should be used

read -p "Enter a string: " str # This reads a line from the user using "read". -p shows a prompt
echo "You entered: $str"

: <<'EXAMPLES' # This is a example block, not meant to execute. This is here to avoid system issues
Below are commands for running CLI programs using shell commands.
These -(flags) and --(long flags) modify the commands and are generally the same for each bash command, but some are unique.

#program -v # Common way to print the version of a package or program

cd #file
# Replace '#file' with your file or folder path to navigate to it. cd is Change Directory. 
cd C:/EXAMPLE/EXAMPLE/LOCATIONEXAMPLE

pwd 
# Prints your current directory. pwd is Print Working Directory.

mkdir new_directory
# Makes a new directory.
mkdir -p dir/subdir # Make a main and sub directory
mkdir -v dir # Print a message after creating the directory
mkdir -m 755 dir # Set permissions for the directory. 755 allows read, write, and execute

rmdir new_directory
# Removes a directory, very similar to mkdir

touch new_file.txt
# Replace 'new_file.txt' with your desired file name and extension. This makes a new file with the name and extension specified
touch -r #file1 #file2 # Makes both files have the same timestamp. file1 is the reference
touch -t yearmonthdayhourminutesecond # Sets the timestamp to the given date
touch -a #file # Change the time of access to current time
touch -m #file # Change the time of modification to current time
touch -b #file # Backup a file before making a timestamp

rm #file 
# Deletes a file. Can also delete directories with -r, and -f to force deletion without confirmation
rm -r #dir # Remove directory
rm -f #file # Force delete item

head / tail #file # Print the first or last 10 lines of a file

grep "search term" #file
# Find a term in a target file
grep -i "search term" #file # Case-insensitive search 
grep -r "search term" #dir # Search inside of directories
grep -n "search term" #file # Print lines that match the search with numbers

wc #file 
# Counts the lines, words, characters inside files
wc -l # Count lines
wc -w # Count words
wc -c # Count characters
wc -m # Count characters, includes spaces
wc -L # Count the longest line
wc -lwm # Count all of the above (not longest line)

ls # Lists the files in the current directory
ls -l # Lists files with more details
ls -a # Lists files with hidden ones
ls -la # Lists files with more details and hidden files
ls -R # Lists files recursively
ls -lh # Lists files with detail and readable file size
ls -lt # Sorts files by modification date
ls -S # Sort files by size
ls -r # Reverse list order
ls -d */ # Lists the directories in the current one
ls -lhS # List largest files first with human-readable sizes
ls -ltr # List oldest files last (reverse time sort)
